This area contains sample programs that exercise all three of the APIs
supported by this module.  The programs for each API are contained in
separate subdirectories:

net-z3950-zoom -- Test programs using the low-level Net::Z3950::ZOOM
	API, which is an as-literal-as-possible translation of the
	ZOOM-C API.  You should almost certainly not bother reading
	these programs: they are for the benefit of the module
	maintainers.

zoom -- Test programs using the object-oriented ZOOM interface, which
	is a nice, Perlish interpretation of the ZOOM abstract API as
	documented at http://zoom.z3950.org/api/

net-z3950 -- Test programs using the obsolescent Net::Z3950 interface,
	which is provided by this distribution as a plug-compatible
	replacement for the old Net::Z3950 module.  There is no reason
	to use this API unless you are maintaining an existing
	application that uses Net::Z3950.

In general, each sample program exists in a different version in all
three directories, under the same name in each.  The programs are:

zoomtst1.pl -- A direct translation of the "zoomtst.c" application
	from the YAZ distribution, except that these versions go on to
	fetch the records that they find, whereas the C version is
	satisfied just to get the hit count.

update.pl -- Create a new database and add a record to it.

In addition, this "sample" directory contains sample records that are
used by the test-suite to exercise the update functionality.  These
are found in the "records" subdirectory.  It also provides a
CQL-to-PQF mapping file (copied blindly from the one in the YAZ
distribution), found in the "cql" directory.
