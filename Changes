Revision history for Perl extension Net::Z3950::ZOOM.

1.10  Thu Jun 15 16:42:47 BST 2006
	- No functional changes, but use Adam's modified API to
	  ZOOM_query_ccl2rpn().  This incompatible change means that
	  RELEASE 1.09 WILL NOT BUILD against any recent YAZ.

1.09  Tue Jun 13 17:44:43 2006
	- Add new function Net::Z3950::ZOOM::query_ccl2rpn(), for
	  client-side CCL compilation.
	- Add new ZOOM::Query::CCL2RPN class, encapsulating CCL
	  compiler functionality as a Query subclass.  This allows
	  client-side CCL to be used for both search and scan.
	- Add two new error-codes, CCL_CONFIG and CCL_PARSE,
	  returned by the client-side CCL facilities.
	- Supply a sample CCL profile file: samples/ccl/default.bib,
	  copied from the same-named file distributed with YAZ.
	- The test-scripts t/12-query.t and t/22-query.t are extended
	  to also test client-side CCL searching.
	- The test-scripts t/15-scan.t and t/25-scan.t are extended
	  to also test client-side CCL scanning.
	- Documentation updated to describe use of CCL.
	- Add a nice, simple update client: samples/zoom/update.pl

1.08  Thu May 11 22:40:41 BST 2006
	- Requires version 2.1.11 of YAZ, not 2.0.11.  This is a
	  bugfix: the old reliance on 2.0.11 was merely a typo.

1.07  Thu May 11 17:45:37 BST 2006
	- Makefile.PL checks for at least version 2.1.11 of YAZ, and
	  refuses to build if it's not present.  Thanks to "gregor"
	  (an otherwise anonymous CPAN tester) for notifying me of the
	  previously poor reporting of failure when running against an
	  earlier YAZ.
	- No changes to functionality or documentation.

1.06  Wed Apr 19 21:11:52 BST 2006
	- Avoid mixed statement/declaration in ZOOM.xs.  *sigh*  Why
	  the heck GCC allows this by default I will never understand.
	- Add (commented out) OPTIMIZE option to Makefile.PL, to turn
	  on -Wdeclaration-after-statement, which makes mixed
	  statement/declaration illegal.

1.05  Wed Apr 12 13:31:27 BST 2006
	- Implementation of asynchronous events!  The Net::Z3950::ZOOM
	  interface provides this through the event, last_event() and
	  event_str() functions.  The ZOOM interface provides it
	  through the ZOOM::event() and ZOOM:event_str() functions,
	  and the ZOOM::Connection class's last_event() function.
	- New sample programs added illustrating both asynchronous
	  interfaces: samples/net-z3950-zoom/zoomtst3.pl and
	  samples/zoom/zoomtst3.pl respectively.  Additional sample
	  programs "async.pl" and "trivial-async.pl" for the ZOOM
	  interface only, the latter being a "shortest possible
	  broadcast search application".
	- Added documentation on writing asynchronous applications.
	- Added test-scripts "t/19-events.t" and "t/29-event.t" for
	  events on an asynchronous connection.
	- Fix ZOOM::Connection::new so that options are handled in
	  accordance with the documentation: applied _before_ the
	  connection is forged, so that "async" and similar options
	  can take effect.

1.04  Mon Apr  3 14:56:11 BST 2006
	- The ZOOM-Perl layer now provides access to the underlying
	  ZOOM-C's character-translation functionality, through new
	  optional arguments to ZOOM::Record's render() and raw()
	  methods, and a new underlying get() method.

1.03  Thu Mar  9 12:55:23 GMT 2006
	- Allow additional key => value pairs as arguments to the
	  ZOOM::Connectoion constructor; these are added as Connection
	  options before the protocol connection is forged.

1.02  Thu Mar  9 11:36:55 GMT 2006
	- Add interface to yaz_version().
	- Emit big warning at startup time if YAZ version is less than
	  2.0.11 (which is what ZOOM-Perl 1.02 requires) unless the
	  file /tmp/ignore-ZOOM-YAZ-version-mismatch exists.
	- Fix incorrect ZOOM-package URL in documentation.
	- Fix typo ("createdb" package) in documentation.
	- The ZOOM::Connection constructor may now be called with only
	  a single argument (host-string) and does not require a
	  dummy port-number argument.

1.01  Thu Dec 22 14:13:34 GMT 2005
	- Place some CODE: chunks in "ZOOM.xs" inside curly brackets
	  so that the declarations they begin with are at the start of
	  the block.  This avoid mixed code/declarations.  (The
	  "correct" solution is to use INIT: clauses in the XS file,
	  but they don't seem to work: the code in them is slapped
	  down right next to the CODE:, so declarations are not
	  acceptable there either.)
	- Add new function Net::Z3950::ZOOM::connection_scan1(), which
	  uses a query object to indicate the start-term.  This opens
	  the way for using CQL queries for scanning once the
	  underlying ZOOM-C code supports this.
	- NOTE BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The ZOOM::Connection
	  method scan() is renamed scan_pqf(), and a new scan() method
	  is introduced which calls the underlying scan1() function.
	  Thus the scan()/scan_pqf() dichotomy is consistent with that
	  between search()/search_pqf().
	- The tests t/15-scan.t and t/25-scan.t now also test for
	  scanning by CQL query.  To support these tests, a new files
	  is added to the distribution, "samples/cql/pqf.properties"
	- Remove nonsensical clause about CQL sort-specifications from
	  the documentation.
	- Add new function Net::Z3950::ZOOM::query_cql2rpn(), for
	  client-side CQL compilation.
	- Add new ZOOM::Query::CQL2RPN class, encapsulating CQL
	  compiler functionality as a Query subclass.
	- Add two new error-codes, CQL_PARSE and CQL_TRANSFORM,
	  returned by the client-side CQL facilities.
	- The test-scripts t/12-query.t and t/22-query.t are extended
	  to also test client-side CQL compilation.
	- Add all the yaz_log*() functions within the Net::Z3950::ZOOM
	  namespace. 
	- Add new ZOOM::Log class for logging, providing aliases for
	  the functions in the Net::Z3950::ZOOM layer.
	- Add diagnostic set to rendering of Exception objects.
	- Documentation added for CQL compilation and logging.

1.00  Wed Dec 14 11:18:33 GMT 2005
	- First distributed version.

0.01  Fri Oct  7 16:14:20 2005
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		--name=Net::Z3950::ZOOM --compat-version=5.8.0 \
		--omit-constant --skip-exporter --skip-ppport \
		--autogen-xsubs yaz/zoom.h -lyaz -lxml2

--

To be done in future releases:
	- Complete, test and document "update.pl"
	- Fix Net::Z3950::ZOOM::record_get() to use a struct datachunk
	  _when_ appropriate, e.g. for "render" but probably not for
	  "database" and "syntax".
	- Create old-style Net::Z3950 compatibility layer.
	- Fix memory leaks in callback functions for option sets.
	- Fix limitation that option-set callback functions must be
	  specified as strings containing package-qualified function
	  names.
